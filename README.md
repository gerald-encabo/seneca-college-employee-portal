## Seneca College (employee-portal)

This Seneca employee webpage is a contract project that I have work with Seneca after I graduated. The purpose of this webpage is to make web-content space for every department at Seneca College including Human Resource, Information Technology Services, The Teaching & Learning Centre and so on. For this web page. they have used Axero Solutions or Axero intranet software, which is a digital workspace for employees. I have used Html, CSS and jQuery for the widgets design of web content in spaces. We have used fontawesome.com for some of the icons that has been used throught the webpages, and forecast7.com for live update Weather API, which can be seen the main page and SeneCan Connect space. I have also used Google Analytics for tracking website traffic,and build axero anayltics for the performance.
